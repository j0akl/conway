# Conways game of life

This is my version of conways game of life. My end goal is to build a computer in the game

TODO:
- use pygame to create the display
- implement logic for  the rules of the game
- build simple structures (gliders, guns, stoppers, etc)
- use simple structures to build logic gates
-- ...

File Structure:
- one file simply runs the display in pygame
- another file houses the logic for the game
- at some point another file should hold an input style for the game, ie how to create patterns

- should there be some sort of pattern class inheritance to make creation easier?
 - cross that bridge later
